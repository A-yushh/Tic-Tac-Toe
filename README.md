Tic Tac Toe Project: A Simple Yet Engaging Game Built with HTML, CSS, and JS

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game loved by people of all ages. It's easy to understand and quick to play, making it a popular choice for a fun distraction. The game has been around for decades, and it has gone through several iterations. Today, we'll explore how to build a simple yet engaging version of Tic Tac Toe using HTML, CSS, and JS.

HTML: The Structure of the Game Board

First, we need to create the game board using HTML. We'll use a table with three rows and three columns to create the nine cells needed for the Tic Tac Toe grid. Each cell will have a unique ID that we'll use later in our JavaScript code to manipulate the content of the cells.

CSS: Styling the Game Board

Now that we have our HTML structure in place, it's time to add some style. We'll use CSS to add a border to each cell and some padding to make the grid more visually appealing. We can also add a hover effect to the cells to indicate when the user is about to select a cell.

JS: Adding Game Logic

Finally, we'll use JavaScript to add the game logic. We'll start by creating an array to represent the game board. We'll initialize each cell with a value of null to indicate that it hasn't been selected yet.

Next, we'll add an event listener to each cell so that when the user clicks on a cell, we can update the value in the array and display the selected symbol (X or O) on the game board. We'll also check if the current player has won the game after each turn.

To check for a winning condition, we'll create a function that checks all possible winning combinations on the game board. If any of these combinations match the current player's symbols, we'll declare them the winner and end the game.

Conclusion

In conclusion, building a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JS is a fun and rewarding project. By combining the structure of HTML, the style of CSS, and the logic of JS, we can create a simple yet engaging game that's perfect for beginners to practice their coding skills. With a little creativity, we can even add additional features to our game, such as an AI opponent or a multiplayer mode. The possibilities are endless! So why not give it a try and build your own version of Tic Tac Toe today?
